# Python_OpenCV-Photo_Conversion-from-Pixels_to_Sketch

Take a photo and then select a style to transform it into – Cartoon, sketch, painting.


  ### 1. Theoretical Knowledge:
  - Background Knowledge:
  
      Converting images into vector has been doing in past times through the use of various software’s such as adobe Illustrator, Photoshop or applying filters on             images.
      
  - Assistance by Python:
  
      With the help of python, developers have been able to convert image into vector form with the help of its own libraries which reduces the time taken in making a         program and further makes things simpler.
      
   - CV2 Libraries:
  
      The CV2 library of python is responsible for handling i.e. reading and saving images while being on the command prompt.
      
   - Installing CV2::
  
      Open the command prompt on your console and then typ:
         
         pip install opencv-python
         
  ### 2. Procedure:
     
   First, we import the cv2 library in our console to use built-in functions from this library with the help of the following line. Then we take a variable name image    and store the read image in it with the help of the following line. Then we take a variable name image and store the read image in it with the help of the following    line. After this the gray image is inverted by the use of the following code. After this the gray image is inverted by the use of the following code. This blurred      image is again inverted and is saved in the variable inverted blur which is mentioned in the code file Now we sketch the inverted blurred image by using the divide    built-in function in library. Now we sketch the inverted blurred image by using the divide built-in function in library.
